Solo Project: Scoreboard Webpage

Hello,

I am enthusiastic to present the scoreboard webpage I have constructed entirely from the ground up. JavaScript has transformed this process into a truly engaging experience, and developing an interactive webpage has been exceptionally satisfying. Please don't hesitate to provide your thoughts, and I appreciate your exploration of my creation!

## Update:
Thanks to @Elijah, my fellow learner from Scrimba, for providing valuable suggestions for my Scoreboard project. The project now boasts improved webpage visuals and script code.

### Changes:
HTML: The onclick attributes inside the buttons now include identifiers within the parentheses, in anticipation of the JavaScript code.
CSS: I made adjustments to several attributes to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage.
JavaScript: I streamlined the code by condensing six functions into just two, with the variables placed inside the identifier's parentheses.
